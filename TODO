scripts:
1. check-kernels should show the currently installed and used kernels.
   Actually query the lilo.conf and elilo.conf files.
   Use md5sum comparisons on the files with tagged names in /boot and /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/ to identify configured kernels.
   Add options to remove kernels that aren't being used.
   Add options to install newly available kernels (using findpkg and fetchpkg)
2. Make set-boot-kernel work.
   Optionally generate an initrd if it doesn't exist for a kernel that is being configured and needs it (generic kernels)
   For lilo, update /boot links using the tag names and run lilo
   For elilo, copy the kernels to /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/ as the tag names   

man-pages:
3. create man page for check-kernels
4. create man page for set-boot-kernel
