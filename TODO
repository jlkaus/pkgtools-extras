pkg-scripts:

kernel-scripts:
1. Update check-kernels
2. Make set-boot-kernel work
3. Make install-new-kernels work with the other tools
4. Make remove-unused-kernels work with the other tools

package building:
1. Create a makefile to handle install, with PREFIX support, so the slackbuild can use it instead of
   directly having the slackbuild put the files in place.  May also build the man pages and compress them, etc.
   Allow installing only the pkg-scripts if you don't want the kernel-scripts (and associated man pages).  Allow
   the reverse as well, for orthogonality, but probably that wouldn't normally be used (kernel-scripts depends on
   pkg-scripts being available).
2. Create a rough slackbuild to generate a valid slackware package of the scripts, config, and man pages

man-pages:
1. Rough in man pages for the pkg-script tools
2. Rough in man pages for the kernel-script tools
